# README

Demo fullstack app using React and Ruby on Rails. The user can upload a comma- or pipe-delimited file (no header) with these columns:

* First name
* Last name
* Email
* Vehicle type
* Vehicle name
* Vehicle length 

They can choose how to sort the output:

* Vehicle type
* Full name

The file is submitted, processed, and returned in tabular format (properly sorted).

Controller tests are included.
